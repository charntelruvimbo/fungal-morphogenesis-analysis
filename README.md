# Fungal Morphogenesis Statistical Analysis  

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether chemical compounds isolated from *Aloe arborescens* affect the morphogenesis of the opportunistic fungus *Candida albicans*.  
The goal of the analysis was to determine whether different experimental treatments lead to statistically significant changes in fungal cell development using formal statistical methods.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the effect of multiple experimental treatments on fungal morphogenesis
- Test whether exposure to specific compounds reduces hyphae formation
- Compare the effectiveness of compounds A and B
- Identify which treatment produces the greatest reduction in hyphae formation
- Perform statistical hypothesis testing using replicated experimental data

## Data
The dataset contains counts of fungal cells observed under seven treatment conditions applied to *Candida albicans*.

Treatments included:
- Aloe arborescens extract
- Compound A (isolated)
- Compound A (commercial)
- Compound B (isolated)
- Compound B (commercial)
- Combination of A and B
- Combination of commercial compounds

For each treatment:
- 5 replicates were recorded  
- 200 cells were counted per replicate  
- Each cell was classified as hypha, bud, or pseudohypha  

## Methods
- Data cleaning and restructuring in R  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Comparison of proportions across treatment groups  
- Statistical hypothesis testing for differences between treatments  
- Analysis of replicated experimental data  
- Reproducible reporting using R Markdown  

## Tools Used
- R  
- R Markdown  
- tidyverse  
- dplyr  
- ggplot2  
- statistical hypothesis testing  

## Results
The analysis evaluated whether exposure to plant-derived compounds significantly altered fungal morphogenesis.  
Statistical tests were used to compare treatment groups and determine which compounds produced the strongest reduction in hyphae formation.
